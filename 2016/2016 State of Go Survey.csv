I am going to say some way to make math not a giant pain in the ass when dealing with an int VS an int64 on a 64bit machine. Some way to make it so there is a set of core math libs with functions that support all the numeric types in a simple way. Sure, i could write my own Abs function for each type. But why should I have to? The StdLib should be here to keep me from writing simple boilerplate for common activities. There are more examples of this in other places, but I won't belabor the point.

I've described developing in go to other folks as walking through my house, getting things done, when suddenly my foot goes clean through a hole in the floor, and then I come to find out the architect left that hole there by design because ""At some point you have to put some work in yourself, you know"".

These all hinder new users getting started and thus hurt further adoption, in my opinion.","The *language* being small, simple and well thought through - all that we normally tout about Go (and everything that the ""go"" *tool* isn't).","A reliable transport protocol over UDP. Seeing QUIC (or equivalent) in the standard library would enable lots of neat network infrastructure improvements. This is something that could fit in the stdlib due to benefiting from standardization (it's better if everyone speaks the same transport) and it's nontrivial enough the people have failed at producing something great so far (no real QUIC implementation for Go, the uTP implementations that exist are not great, my own attempt was bad and turned out difficult. :)","Having a de facto package and version management story for builds. No, this will not be possible without having some sort of metadata specifying required versions. No, it won't handle every corner case in the universe. But it would simplify builds for people everywhere and be a more serious answer than ""just copy every dependency everywhere and update them when critical vulnerabilities are discovered, everywhere, maybe, some time"".",,It's great that it's being done!,Sweden

STATIC LINKING ALL THE WAY!","Magic things. I cannot reimplement the standard library, as things tend to use secret hooks, like runtime.semacquire or registerPoolCleanup.

I also dislike make/append/..., as they use compiler secret sauce to effectively be generics, without having generics. I don't mind not having generics, but I *do* have somethingn against secret sauce.

Also, the cwd hack for plan9 bugs me.","It compiles fast, and it's both structured and concise. It just... Looks nicer. It feels like C and Python had a baby that was more C than python.","Cleanup. The Go1 compatibility is annoying. Maybe more exposure of the magic parts,","A method should be able to implement an interface if its return values are compatible. Imagine you have a type with a method that returns a struct. If you want multiple implementations and an interface that covers it, then you either need to return a specific struct or a specific interface, meaning that a shared dependency on an interface definition is necessary. This ruins convenient ""ad hoc"" interface declarations, and is very annoying, sometimes impossible to work around,

A type used as argument to a function call is automatically converted to an interface if it implements it, so it's not like go is entirely free of this kind of automatic conversion.

I find publishing artefacts to a repository to be alot better than just pointing to a github project.  Github projects might move and may be unstable.  That is why it is better to not depend on projects, but to build versioned artefacts from projects and depend on those.  You only have to pull in a few files and they are immutable - e.g pointing to master on github makes maintaining a vendor project a nightmare because of breaking changes, and versioning with a git commit is a hack to work around the fact that you can't version normally, with artefacts and version metadata.  Another problem is if a project is deleted everything will break - and setting up a mirror is nowhere near as easy as it would be with something like nexus.

You cannot easily test what error object you have. If you create a custom error message (e.g. you vary an id in the error string), you cannot compare the error string to determine what type of error you have. And, seriously, you shouldn't compare err.Error() to determine what type of error you have.  You could create a package exported error object and always return that but that precludes the ability to create custom error messages (which you should always do for readability and detail).  Instead tweak the API to allow a user defined error id field on the error interface. Yes, true, it would require the programmer set the id every time--fine. Most of the time you don't need to do this. It is not often when you need to know specifically what error you have. If that's particularly problematic the programmer can create an error factory. On a final note I really like the idea of a ""cause"" stack as introduced by https://github.com/pkg/errors.  Since returning an error object back to the caller is a common pattern, you lose the location the error was created (you don't have access to the stack). So instead, annotate with single stack frame (well then it is not a stack frame is it I guess) the file and line where the error was created and include that, by default, in the string returned by Error().",The stripped down nature of the language.,A decent error object. See above.,A decent error object. See above.,,,"Arlington, MA"

For example:
    Go language - excellent, complete, ongoing improvements
    Go for Web - looks good to someone like me on the outside.
    Go for 3D games - not really feasible, missing good support libraries.
    Go for PC applications - not really feasible, missing good support libraries.
    Go for Mobile applications - not really feasible missing good support libraries.
The Go language is both excellent and severely under-utilized.  Using Go and applying its design principles to other areas like 3D games, UI based applications, and mobile applications would launch it to being the most used and useful of all languages. This depends on missing support libraries which take time and money to develop. Good support libraries are also hard to get right and do not necessarily rely on the same core competencies of the core Go team.

Go-mobile is an excellent example of a project that may be on the wrong design path as something that I desperately want to use as part of the Vu 3D engine, but cannot based on what appears to be a very un-modular design (need build knowledge separate from OpenGL bindings, separate from OS bindings). https://github.com/xlab/android-go may be on the right design path.","Ottawa, Canada"

",currently exploring godep and govendor,govendor,It appears to be the least difficult choice to use,"I have several packages of Go projects in private repos that are shared across multiple projects. Managing the private package is difficult. For example consider mycommon as a private package and mywebservice as a Go project that imports mycommon. I would like to easily vendor mycommon in release branches of mywebservice, but at the same time in master of mywebservice I want the ability to reference mycommon from my GOPATH while developing changes to mycommon while running mywebservice. At the same time I want to vendor all other third party libraries. ",Yes,sort of. I commit all of our third party libs in vendor in our source control system. Its important that all devs on the team are developing with the same versions of third party libraries. ,Did not manage them,No,No,1,"I would to be able to mix and match between vendor/ and GOPATH more easily. I Would like a mechanism that would allow one to configure their environment to have, on a per package basis, the ability to run a package from the GOPATH even if it were versioned.

Communicating sequential processes is a very different way of thinking about the world (at least from my experience in Java and other threaded languages). Having more tools and methodologies to solve problems is always a good thing.

It doesn't have the commercial backing of Swift.  Google doesn't promote it or require it for making money in the Google ecosystem.  It also doesn't have all the bells and whistles of Swift - which is a good thing, but it makes it a tougher sell for less experienced programmers (and sadly even many more experienced programmers) who are attracted to the flashy features of Swift.

If we really wanted to drive Go adoption, then we would need to:
1)  Make it have the absolute best mobile app development tools, especially for Android (c'mon, Google, do you even care if Go succeeds?).
2)  Make it be the absolute standard for microservice development.  It's getting there, but it needs to be THE first class language of AWS to fully succeed.  Now, it's an afterthought (e.g. no native Go lambdas).  Google and Amazon don't compete on programming language.  Maybe Larry should call Jeff?
3)  Turn the dial VERY SLIGHTLY on the bells and whistles to pick up some additional use cases.  For example, I was disappointed to see what I thought was a fairly well developed table object get summarily dropped.  This would have opened Go to adoption for a host of mathematical applications.  Generics is the other commonly cited missing feature.

I'd be happy to discuss this subject further.","The simplicity, the tool set, the community.  I'm a strong believer in the philosophies behind Go.  As I've said in the previous question, though, that philosophy needs to be balanced against a little more drive for adoption.

Would be nice to also be able to type alias for things like function signatures passed as function parameters.,,"Generics. I realize this is hugely controversial subject in the Go community but other new languages have appeared since Go and show that compile time static type checking and generics can be done well. The Go community goes out of its way to perpetually avoid confronting this and no meaningful experimentation even transpires to research the subject. If there is one thing that ruffles a lot of folks in the Go community it is to mention the subject of generics. This is the one thing the Go community as an aggregate gets defensive about and even stoop to calling into question the integrity of those that raise this issue. I think Go risk getting passed by eventually if it continues in this posture of refusing to meet parity with some of the other very nice languages that have appeared since Go. It doesn't have to be that way, though, because Go has a great deal going for it. Mutability control in the language and more adeptness for functional programming are good areas to look at that language spec in.",,Thanks for taking the pulse of Go programmers.,Seattle metroplex area (aka Puget Sound)

Goroutines are a fine way to manage concurrency-as-optimization, but they provide very few benefits for concurrency-as-error-decoupling. As a result, my Go programs feel full of fragile, defensive code. This is contrasted by my experience with Erlang/Elixir, where I spend very little time or overhead on defensive coding.

Writing concurrent code in Go feels extremely similar to writing concurrent code in another threaded language, just without the notions of expensive thread creation found elsewhere. The primitives -- thread-safe queues, locks, thread-unsafe data structures -- are the same as those found in any other language, but with potentially thousands (or millions) of threads rather than dozens. 

In other words, I feel like the tooling around managing units of concurrency does not match the potential for complexity introduced by making those units so easily available. Go is missing its OTP framework, to reference Erlang again.

As a result, I write in Go primarily because it offers the best concurrency model of the languages that I can use for $work for backend services without causing a stink.",It's a preemptively scheduled concurrent language that I can use at $work. Generally straightforward to write and read. Fast enough for the speed to be an advantage over primary $work scripting language.,"Proper logging, tools to manage error handling",,,"Was encouraged to fill it out by a colleague,  but I suspect my Go exposure is on the low side to have significant signal to contribute to issues of 3rd party code management and the like.",Amsterdam

Recently, Microsoft has taken the stance with their .Net languages and frameworks to modularize their libraries to allow full application isolation with respect to dependencies through Nuget.  I would love to see a streamlined version of this with Go.  I would absolutely LOVE to do more meta-programming in Go.  I don't want to need to have go ""installed"" on a system and require the hierarchical folder structures for source code and standard library plus environment variables to link it all.  I would far rather have a compiler binary with a single standard library file and a config file so I could just drop those three files into any source code folder and enable isolated coding and compiling of solutions. Imagine if those solutions could in turn execute the local folder compiler to allow developers to perform isolated ""ahead-of-time"" compilation with all requisite dependencies on the production target machine.  That way deployments to production machines would have ""everything needed in a bundle"" per application and deployment.  This would also allow for much more powerful ""writing go code to write go code that is then compiled and executed"" meta-programming.",,,Lakeland Florida
